Giggle
======

Giggle was a fun experiment. It was a site crawler that mimics the basic behavior of a search engine crawler. The crawler returns every words it has crawled, and maps each one against a list of the URLs it's appeared on and a score of how relevant that word is to the URL. I've refactored the crawler a few times to increase it's crawl speed.
